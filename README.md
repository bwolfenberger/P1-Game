## About The Project

![Save the Planet Screenshot](saveThePlanetScreenshot.jpg)

Save the Planet is a click-based game where your goal is to....save the planet!

This was my first official app when I was worked on foundational coding principles.

Object-oriented design was an emphasis for scalability and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code writing principles.
