The year is 2121. Most of humanity now lives on planets spread throughout the solar system. Earth was destroyed by an asteroid in 2100 which brings us to your current objective.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to protect planet HTRAE from a similar fate.

You need to blast any astroids away before they touch HTRAE. The planet will take damage depending on the size of the astroid. If the health of HTRAE reaches 0%, the planet will explode.

This job used to be easy but there seems to be an ever increasing number of astroids heading toward the seemingly doomed planet...

Goodluck!
